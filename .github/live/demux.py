"""Exercise hdw4s-demux against stand-in slots, in both directions.

Every check here is run twice: once expecting green, and once with the thing it
guards deliberately broken, expecting red. A check that has never rejected
anything is not known to reject anything -- and a guard that refuses everything
would also look green, so the permit arm is not optional either.

WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS STOOD IN FOR, said here rather than left to be
inferred. Real: hdw4s-demux itself, unmodified, over a real TCP socket, with
real HTTP, real cookies and real UNIX-socket upstreams. Stood in for: the
sessions. The backends are small HTTP servers that report which slot they are.
There is NO BROWSER in this file and no picture is decoded, so nothing here is
evidence that a desktop renders -- only that arrival, identity and routing are
right. journey.py and isolation.py are what see a picture.

THE ARM THAT MATTERS MOST is test_pooled_connection. A stand-in reverse proxy at
its defaults opens a fresh upstream connection per request and does not
reproduce the cross-session defect at all, so a router tested only that way
passes while the defect is live. Here the two requests are deliberately sent
down ONE connection.
